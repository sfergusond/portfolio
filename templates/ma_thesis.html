	<p class="mx-3">
    What is the relationship between the level of economic interdependence among states and the 
    geography of defense spending? I argue that as the level of economic interdependence in a 
    region increases, the geographic structure of defense spending weakens. States in a highly 
    interdependent system will have defense expenditures that correlate weakly to the defense 
    expenditures of nearby states. Conversely, in a less interdependent system, states with high 
    defense expenditure are more likely to be located near other states with high defense 
    expenditure. The argument is evaluated by constructing spatial models of defense spending in 
    Europe in the period of 1995-2019. The models will produce the Moranâ€™s I statistic, which 
    measures the geographic structure of defense spending, and a count of threat responsive
    countries, defined as states with high defense expenditure in proximity to other states with high 
    defense expenditure. Foreign direct investment flows is used to operationalize the economic 
    interdependence variable. The resulting linear regressions shows a significant inverse 
    relationship between the level of foreign direct investment and the number of threat responsive 
    countries
